This repository contains the solutions of bot building challenges of Artificial Intelligence section of HackerRank.

Challenges:
1. Bot saves princess (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess?hr_b=1) - Princess Peach is trapped in one of the four corners of a square grid. You are in the center of the grid and can move one step at a time in any of the four directions. Can you rescue the princess?

2. Bot saves princess 2 (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess2?hr_b=1) - In this version of "Bot saves princess", Princess Peach and bot's position are randomly set. Can you save the princess?

3. BotClean (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/botclean?hr_b=1) - Meet the bot MarkZoid. It's a cleaning bot whose sensor is a head mounted camera and whose actuators are the wheels beneath it. It's used to clean the floor. The bot here is positioned at the top left corner of a 5*5 grid. Your task is to move the bot to clean all the dirty cells.

4. BotClean Stochastic (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/botcleanr?hr_b=1) - The game Bot Clean took place in a deterministic environment. In this version, the bot is given 200 moves to clean as many dirty cells as possible. The grid initially has 1 dirty cell. When the bot cleans this cell, a new cell in the grid is made dirty. The new cell can be anywhere in the grid.The bot here is positioned at the top left corner of a 5*5 grid. Your task is to move the bot to appropriate dirty cell and clean it.

5. BotClean Large (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/botcleanlarge?hr_b=1) - MegaMaid is a robot whose function is to move through a matrix and clean all of its dirty cells. It's positioned in some cell of an  matrix of dirty (d) and clean (-) cells. Given the robot's current location and the configuration of dirty and clean cells in the matrix, print the next operation MegaMaid will perform (e.g., UP, CLEAN, etc.) on a new line.
